pySnap
======================

pySnap is a python application for doing time-lapse photography. It was originally created for the Raspberry Pi, but it will work on any Debian-based Linux distro.


To run it, first clone the repository with `git clone git://github.com/Aaron1011/time-lapse-photography.git`, or click the Download ZIP button on the right side of this page.  

Then, run the program by running `python path/to/autorun.py` in a terminal. You can drag and drop `autorun.py` into the terminal to get the path to it.
